# Mastermind
The classic code-breaking game designed by Mordecai Meirowitz, done in Ruby!

UI:
  - This game will be played entirely in the command line. It will utilize
    the 'colorize' gem to properly display the code at the end of the game,
    as well as color coding the instructions for the available colors.

  - It will also utilize squares to represent the "peg" positions, and color feedback
    to indicate where there is a correct color guess, correct position guess, or both.

Inputs:
  - Takes a starter code for the player to break. This can be input by one user for a two
    player game, or generated by the game for one player games.
  
  - Takes a role selection input, i.e. code breaker or code maker.

  - Takes a maximum number of guesses input to determine max game length.

  - Continually takes guess inputs from the code breaker until the guess matches to code or
    they have reached the maximum number of guesses.

Outputs:
  - After a guess is made, it should return a sequence of squares with color feedback on the user's
    guess.

  - When the game ends, output the original color code and a game-won or game-lost message.
